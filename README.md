Task-Based Round for Junior Front End Position at NITEX
Technologies Used
During the task-based round for the Junior Front End position at NITEX, I utilized a combination of tools and libraries to enhance my productivity and create a high-quality project. Here's why I chose to use each of these technologies:

1. Tailwind CSS
Why I Chose Tailwind CSS:

I opted for Tailwind CSS over SASS or LESS for several reasons. Tailwind CSS allows me to write CSS directly in my HTML code, eliminating the need to create separate CSS files and import them. This approach streamlines the development process, as I don't have to remember class names. It significantly boosted my productivity, as I could write and style components inline.

2. React Icons
Why I Chose React Icons:

I preferred React Icons over alternatives like Font Awesome. Whenever I needed icons, I could easily find a wide variety of choices available in the React Icons library. This convenience made it my go-to choice for handling icons in the project.

3. Framer Motion
Why I Chose Framer Motion:

For handling animations, I selected Framer Motion over React Spring or other libraries. Framer Motion is user-friendly and offers a plethora of captivating animations. Its popularity means that I can find helpful resources and support easily, which is a valuable asset when working on animation-heavy tasks.

4. Lottie Animation
Why I Chose Lottie React:

Although it was my first time using Lottie, I found it straightforward and efficient. Lottie React provides a diverse range of captivating animations, and the fact that it's free to use made it an attractive choice. I was delighted with the results it delivered for the project.

5. Splide JS
Why I Chose Splide JS:

I opted for Splide over writing custom code or using Swiper JS. Time constraints made it challenging to code everything from scratch, and I had previous experience with Swiper. Therefore, I wanted to try something new and decided to use Splide for the first time, adding a fresh approach to the project.

By leveraging these technologies and libraries, I was able to create a robust and visually appealing project during the task-based round, while also enhancing my efficiency and productivity in the development process.
